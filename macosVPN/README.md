# nix VPN installation script
-- currently only working for MacOS
(has been tested and confirmed to work on Mojave, is expected to work on High Sierra. Older versions of the operating systems might experience unexpected results)

This script will install the GCC Student and Library VPNs. 

## Installation
Control click on the vpnInstaller script and choose open. (Because the script is not signed as a trusted developer you MUST control click on it or run from terminal )
- to install the VPNs you must have root access to this computer, as commands will be elevated as `sudo`
- read instructions carefully. 

I cannot verify the validity of your O365 account password. If the vpn fails to connect try running the script again.
