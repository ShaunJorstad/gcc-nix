# nix VPN installation script
(has been tested and confirmed to work on Mojave, is expected to work on High Sierra. Older versions of the operating systems might experience unexpected results)

This script will install the GCC Student. This provides access to library resources, network storage, and network hosted sites such as Glance while off campus. 

## Installation
Control click on the vpnInstaller script and choose open. (Because the script is not signed as a trusted developer you MUST control click on it or run from terminal )
- to install the VPNs you must have root access to this computer, as commands will be elevated as `sudo`
- read instructions carefully. 

I cannot verify the validity of your O365 account password. If the vpn fails to connect try running the script again.

## Use

Post installation you should see a vpn icon in your status bar, see the photo below as an example. Connect to the student vpn with the provided option within this menu.
